It is a fact that the Earth is round. Columbus knew he wouldn't sail off the edge of the world. But alternative geographies persisted even after sailing around the world had become common. To this day, some [retain] doubts about that [consensus].The [fundamental] belief of flat-Earthers is that the planet is centered on the North Pole and bounded by a wall of ice. The sun, moon, and planets are a few hundred miles above the surface. They believe that NASA and other government [institutions] conspire to convince otherwise [rational] minds into believing the Earth is round. The [implication] is that NASA is guarding the Antarctic ice wall that surrounds the planet. Flat-Earthers argue that NASA manipulates its photos, based on observations that the color of the oceans changes from image to image, and that continents seem to be in different places.

The world's population will hit 10 billion in 2050. According to a new report, there needs to be significant [interventions] if we are to ensure everyone has a balanced diet. This must be done while, at the same time, reducing poverty and avoiding [instability]. Preventing more land from being converted into agriculture requires major financial [investments] in feed quality and grazing management. Here are a few of the proposed solutions in the report: • Dramatically reduce the amount of food that we lose or waste. Make consumers [accountable] for any waste. • Boost crop [productivity], and increase the output of milk and meat. To prevent more land from being used for agriculture, we need to find ways to get more than one crop harvest per year. • Create an [initiative] that shifts the diets of high-meat consumers toward plant-based foods. Meat is very resource intensive.

Sanga Moses had a nice job in Kampala, Uganda's largest city. One day, he was on the way to visit his mother in a rural village when he met his [younger] sister, and she began to cry. Children in Uganda have to gather wood for the family because it is needed for cooking [fuel]. Since his sister was out gathering wood [so often], she was losing her opportunity for [an education]. This inspired Moses to start his own company to [solve] the energy crisis in his country, so he quit his job. Soon, all his money was gone, he had to sell everything he had in order to make ends meet. His girlfriend [left] him because she thought he was [on the verge of] wasting his life. Currently, he is the CEO of his own company, which makes fuel from farm waste. This fuel is cleaner, better, and cheaper than [wood]. Through his company, deforestation and indoor air pollution are [stopped], farmers and women can earn a living, and more kids are able to stay in school. Moses also fell in love with a beautiful woman; they got married, and now they have a daughter.
